# Fiber Student API

This is my a very simple API made with Go, with basic auth for deleting and updating
student data. This project is my very first experience with Go and Fiber.

This project uses the MIT license.

## Development

To create the database locally, you should make a new dedicated user, the credentials
of which can be found in the `.env.example` file. You can access the dump in `db.sql`.
